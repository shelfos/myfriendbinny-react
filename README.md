# Overview

This is a single-page web application built using React to track bin storage.  It's very basic so far - just a bin list and a page to enter new bins.  The hope is to make this a full-fledged web application that connects to a database for all the connectivity and data handling.

# Web Pages

I created a main landing page with a header and menu on the left.  I also have a Bin List screen and a screen for adding new bins.

# Development Environment

VSCode for the IDE
I used React, Javascript, and CSS
